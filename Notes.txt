OOP in C# (NOTES)

1. Classes and Object
	Class is the description of objects propety and behaviour.
	Class is the collection of self contained independent variable(property) and 	method(member function) which works together to perform one or more specific tasks
	
	SYNTAX:
	<access_modifier> class <class_name> {
		//properties and methods
	}

	Object is the real world entity or instance of class and consumes memory
	Once class is defined then object is created using new keyword
	Then Object can access the property and method via (.) dot operator

	SYNTAX:
	<class_name> <object_name> = new <class_name>();

2. Static Class and Static Constructor
	Static class is a class with static keyword and cannot be instantiated
	Static class contains static data member and member function
	Static class is sealed meaning it cannot be inherited

	SYNTAX:
	<access_modifier> static class <class_name> {
		//static property and methods
	}
	We can access Static class property and method using <class_name>.(property/method)

	
	Static constructor is a special member function that is used to initialize the static 	property of object and is defined with static keyword
	Static have no argument or modifier
	Static constructor is invoked implicitly before first instance is created or any 	static member referenced

	SYNTAX:
	static <class_name>() {
		//define static property of class
	}


3. Constructor
	In C#, Constructor are special member function that is used to initialize he property 	of a class and is invoked automatically when a class is instantiated.
	
	There are two types of Constructor in c#:
	1) Parameterless Constructor
		- It is also known as default constructor. This type of constructor doesn't 
		contain any parameter. Used to set default values for class properties
		SYNTAX:
		<access_modifier> <class_name>() {
			//define property
		}
	2) Parameterized Constructor
		- This type of constructor contains one or more parameters which is generally 		used to initialized the property of class with specific values at the time 		of object creation.
		
		SYNTAX:
		<access_modifier> <class_name>(p1, p2, ...) {
			this.prop1 = p1
			this.prop2 = p2
			.	
			.
		}

4. Structure
	Structure is collection of heterogenous data under single variable. It is similar to 	class but more lightweight and mainly used for small data objects
 
	KEY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STRUCTURE AND CLASS
	-> Structure is a value type whereas class is a reference type
	-> Structures are stored in stack whereas classes are stored in heap
	-> We cannot define parameterless constructor in sturcture but we can in classes
 
	SYNTAX
	<access_modifier> struct <struct_name> {
    		property and methods
	} 

5. Enumeration
	Enumeration or (enum) is a user defined value type that consists of set of named 	constants called enumerator list
	It makes code more readable and meaningful by using names instead of numbers for 	related constants values
 
	KEY POINTS:
	-> Enum are value type
	-> By default, the underlying type is int
	-> Can change the underlying type to byte, short etc
	-> By default first element of enum list is represented by integer 0
	-> Can assign specific numeric values to the names
 
	SYNTAX
	enum <enum_name> {
    		//enum list
	}

6. Inheritance
	Inheritance is a process of acquring property of one object into another object.
	It is the process of creating new class from existing class
	It maintains IS-A relationship or parent-child relationship
	
	USES: -> code resuability and to perform runtime polymorphism
	
	Base Class: Class whose propeties are inherited are known as base or parent class
	Derived Class: Class who inherits the properties from parent/base class are known as 	derived class/ child class
	
	TYPES OF INHERITANCE:
	i) Single Level Inheritance: In single level inheritance, a child class inherits the 	properties and methods from a parent class.
	    SYNTAX:
	    <access_modifier> class <parent_name> {
	        //property and method
	    }
	    
	    <access_modifier> class <child_class> : <parent_class> {
	        //inherits property and method from parent class
	        //its own property and method
	    }
	    
	ii) Multi Level Inheritance: In multi level inheritance, a child class inherits the 	properties and methods from a parent class which in turns inherits properties and 	methods from a grand parent class
	    SYNTAX:
	    
	    <access_modifier> class <grandparent_class> {
	        //property and method
	     }
	    
	    <access_modifier> class <parent_class> : <grandparent_class> {
	        //inherits property and method from grandparent class
	        //its own property and method
	    }
	    
	    <access_modifier> class <child_class> : <parent_class> {
	        //inherits property and method from parent and grandparent class
	        //its own property and method
	    }
	   
	iii) Hierarchical Inheritance: In heirarchical inheritance, a parent class property 	and methods are inherited by one or more child class
	    SYNTAX: 
	    
	    <access_modifier> class <parent_name> {
	         //property and method
	    }
	    
	    <access_modifier> class <child_class1> : <parent_class> {
	        //inherits property and method from parent class
	        //its own property and method
	    }
	
	    <access_modifier> class <child_class2> : <parent_class> {
	        //inherits property and method from parent class
	        //its own property and method
	    }
	
	   <access_modifier> class <child_classn> : <parent_class> {
	         //inherits property and method from parent class
	        //its own property and method
	    }

7. Interface
	Interface in C# defines what a class must do but not how it does it.
	It contains method signature, properties, events or indexer -- but no implementation
	A class or struct that implements an interface must provide the actual behavior for 	all its memeber
	
	KEY POINTS:
	 interface keyword is used.
	Cannot have fields or constructors
	supports multiple interitance -> one child class implements multiple parent class
	provides abstraction
 
	SYNTAX:
	interface <interface_name> {
	    <return_type> method1();
	    <return_type> method2();
	    .
	    .
	    .
	}

8. this keyword
	this keyword in C# is a reference variable that is used to represent object of current 	class.
	
	USES:
		-> to avoid naming confliction between parameter of constructor or method and 			property of class
		-> to invoke method or property of current class
		-> as parameter or argument of method
		-> used to define indexer
9. base keyword
	base keyword in C# is a reference variable that represents object or instance.
	
	USES:
		-> to invoke constructor or immediate parent class (i.e base(<parameter>))
		-> used to invoke member function or method of immediate parent class (i.e. 			base.<method_name>(<parameter>)
		-> used to access property of immediate parent class i.e base.<property_name>

10. Abstract class and Abstract Methods
	Abstract class is defined with the abstract keyword that cannot be instantiated.
	Abstract class can contain abstract methods and non abstract methods or both
	Abstract class is inherited (i.e special base class)

	SYNTAX:
	<access_modifier> abstract class <class_name> {
		//abstract method
		//non abstract methods
	}
	

	Abstract method is also defined with abstract keyword that have no implementation (i.e only 	declaration of the method)
	Abstract method is overridden in child class

	SYNTAX:
	<access_modifier> abstract <return_type> <function_name>(<parameters>);

11. Property and its type
	A property is a member of class that provides flexible mechanism to read, write, or 	compute the value of a private field. 
	Properties are like smart fields -- they encapsulate data while allowing access via 	get and set accessors.
	They help enforce encapsulation by hiding the implementation details and exposing a 	clean interface.
	
	SYNTAX:
	<access_modifier> class <class_name> {
		<access_modifier(private)> <datatype> property1;
		...
		<access_modifier> <datatype> Property1 {
			set {
				property1 = value;
			}
			get {
				return property1;
			}
		}
	}

	TYPES OF PROPERTIES:
	i) Read-Only Property
		It allows only reading the value. You cannot modify it outside the class.
		It is done via get accessor

	EXAMPLE:
		class Student {
			private int rollNumber;
			
			//read only property
			public int RollNumber {
				get { return rollNumber;}
			}

			public Student(int rollNumber) {
				this.rollNumber = rollNumber;
			}
		}

		Explanation:
			-> Here, RollNumber is read-only
			-> You can read it from outside: student.RollNumber
			-> Cannot assign student.RollNumber = 5; --> throw compile-time error
	
	ii) Write-Only Property
		It allows only writing the value. You cannot read it from outside.
		It is done via set accessor
		
		EXAMPLE:
			class BankAccount {
				private string password;
				
				// write-only property
				public string Password {
					set{password = value}
				}
			}

			Explanation:
				-> Password can be set like: account.Password = "HelloWorld";
				-> Cannot read it back: string p = account.Password; --> error

	iii) Read-Write Property
		It allows both reading and writing the value;
		It done using both set and get accessors;

		EXAMPLE:
			class Employee {
				private double salary;
				
				//Read-Write property
				public double Salary {
					set { salary = value;}
					get { return salary;}
				}
				
			}
			
		Explanation:
			You can read: double s = employee.Salary
			You can write: employee.Salary = 50000;

	iv) Auto-Implemented Property
		It provides automatic backing field generated by compiler.
		You don't explicitly declare a private field -- compiler does it for you

		EXAMPLE:
			class Product {
				//Auto Implemented Read-Write property
				public string Name {get; set;}
				
				//Auto-Implemented Read-Only Property
				public int Id {get;}

				public Product(int id) {
					Id = id; //can only be set in constructor
				}
			}
	
		Explanation:
			Name --> Read-Write, fully auto.
			Id --> Read-only, initialized only in the constructor or in declaration
